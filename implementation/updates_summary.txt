## 1. Backend Updates

### Fixed Import Issues
- Modified neuraforge/llm/core.py to handle different import locations for OutputParserException
- Updated import to try `langchain_core.exceptions` first, then fall back to `langchain_core.output_parsers`
- Code:
```python
# Try to import from the newer location first, then fall back to the older location if needed
try:
    from langchain_core.exceptions import OutputParserException
except ImportError:
    # Fall back to the older location
    from langchain_core.output_parsers import OutputParserException
```

### Fixed Ollama Integration Issues
- Updated the Ollama integration in core.py to handle both newer and older versions of the Ollama class
- Added compatibility layer to try using OllamaLLM from langchain_ollama first
- Removed streaming parameter when using older Ollama class to prevent validation errors
- Code:
```python
# Try to use the newer OllamaLLM from langchain_ollama if available
try:
    from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM as LLMClass
    USE_NEW_OLLAMA = True
except ImportError:
    # Fall back to the older Ollama from langchain_community
    from langchain_community.llms import Ollama as LLMClass
    USE_NEW_OLLAMA = False
```

### Added Environment Configuration
- Created .env file in backend directory
- Configured Ollama base URL and API settings
- Added proper instructions for accessing the API

### Improved Server Configuration
- Updated server.py to use app as an import string for better reload/workers support
- Added clearer access instructions in server output
- Code:
```python
# Using the app as an import string to enable reload and workers
uvicorn.run("neuraforge.api:app", host=host, port=port, reload=debug)
```

### Added CORS Support
- Added CORS middleware to FastAPI app to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend
- Code:
```python
# Add CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allows all origins (not recommended for production)
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allows all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allows all headers
)
```

## 3. System Integration

### Created Start Script
- Created start_neuraforge.bat to start both frontend and backend servers
- Code:
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting NeuraForge Development Environment...

REM Start the backend server in a new window
start cmd /k "cd %~dp0implementation\backend && python server.py"

REM Wait a moment to ensure the backend starts first
timeout /t 2 > NUL

REM Start the frontend server in a new window
start cmd /k "cd %~dp0implementation\frontend && npm run dev"

echo NeuraForge servers started!
echo.
echo Backend: http://localhost:8000
echo Frontend: http://localhost:3000
echo.
echo Press any key to close this window...
pause > NUL
```

### Created Test Interface
