Backend SSE was crashing before your agents ever reached Ollama: the Postgres pool tried to connect with the DSN postgresql+asyncpg://…, which asyncpg rejects. Every call to /api/v1/submit_task/stream then blew up, so the frontend never saw responses.

I updated the DSN scheme to the asyncpg-compatible form in:

.env
.env.example
staging.env.example
production.env.example
Restart the stack so the new env values load (e.g. from backend: docker compose up --build, or docker compose up -d if the image is current). Once the backend is back up, trigger the conversation again—the SSE stream should stay open, tasks will run through the orchestrator, and outputs will be saved to Postgres/Qdrant as intended.

Next up:

Bring the stack back (docker compose up …) and retry the conversation flow.
Keep an eye on the backend logs for any lingering llm_… errors while the agents are running.
