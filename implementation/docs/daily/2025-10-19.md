# Daily Log — 2025-10-19

## Highlights
- Backend/frontend streaming envelope parsing updated (`TaskContext.tsx`).
- Documented manual validation steps in `docs/runbooks/frontend_streaming_validation.md`.
- Drafted the Phase 7 streaming alignment sync agenda (`docs/meetings/phase7_streaming_alignment_sync.md`).

## Next Actions
1. Execute the streaming validation smoke test following the new runbook.
   - Capture required screenshots and drop them into `docs/daily-updates/assets/2025-10-19/`.
2. Confirm availability and send calendar invite for the streaming alignment sync (target 2025-10-21).
   - Use agenda stored at `docs/meetings/phase7_streaming_alignment_sync.md`.

## Notes
- Frontend build (`npm run build`) succeeds; manual UI validation still pending.
- Reminder to replace the asset README with captured evidence after the smoke test.
