# MCP Tool Onboarding Log

Use this log to track when tools are enabled in each environment. Update the table as part of the rollout checklist.

| Date | Tool | Environment | Owner | Notes / PR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-10-13 | `research/search/duckduckgo` | dev | backend | Alias wired & diagnostics reporting planned status |
| _yyyy-mm-dd_ | `research/search/duckduckgo` | staging | | |

Add rows as onboarding progresses. Keep secrets out of this file—store only references (e.g., “API key stored in Vault entry `mcp-tavily`”).
